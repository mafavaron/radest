# radest - Estimation of clear sky radiation by ASCE simplified method.

This is a Python port of routines found in pbl_met, thermodynamical and radiation section.

The purpose of this library is to provide a quick way to generate realistic global radiation estimates to compare with actual readings, for evaluation and validation purposes.

The radest.py library is an intellectual property of both myself, Mauri Favaron, and Servizi Territorio srl. But, it is heavily based on ASCE report, and worth placement in the public domain.
